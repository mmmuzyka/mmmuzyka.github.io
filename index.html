        <h1 class="title">Why English is important </h1>
        <div class="home-content">
            <p class="home-description">Nowadays, English runs the world.
                English is not a special skill anymore, but it is a required one for every person. That is the reason
                why it is important not only to understand others and deliver your thoughts in English but also to do it
                correctly.
                English can give you many opportunities in life that you have not had before, such as getting to know
                other cultures better, communicating with foreigners while traveling abroad, watching movies in the
                original language, working on more global projects with international companies, etc.
                The learning process of English does not have to be hard. It can be interesting and involving, and I am
                the one who can introduce you to easy learning of English, and hopefully, you will enjoy it as I do.</p>
