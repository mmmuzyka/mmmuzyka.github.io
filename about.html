                    My name is Mark and I have been practicing tutoring English for 6 years. I have tried myself first
                    as an English tutor when I was 15. I was scared and inexperienced, which I cannot say about myself
                    now. I have helped more than 20 young learners to feel freer in expressing themselves in English,
                    and I am extremely proud of them and myself.

                <p>
                    Besides my tutoring experience, I study English and Literature at LCC International University,
                    which is American-styled, where the language of instruction is English. I have taken an Academic and
                    Creative Writing course, Public Speaking, Linguistics, and TESOL (Teaching English as a second
                    language.) I have also passed TOEFL.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I prepare materials by myself and try to organize my lessons to be as creative as possible in a
                    playful way. I also try to be not only a teacher for my students but also a friend, which is I guess
                    a perfect strategy to break a speaking barrier. The last but not least thing which is extremely
                    important for my students is that there is NO HOMEWORK in my classes.
